# Word Guessing Game with Hill Climbing

Welcome to the Word Guessing Game with Hill Climbing! This is an open-source project implemented in Python that challenges players to guess a target word using the hill climbing optimization technique.

## Description

The Word Guessing Game is a collaborative effort of students from the University of Management and Technology (UMT), led by Syed Paiker Hussain Bukhari. This project aims to provide a fun and interactive command-line game where players attempt to guess a word by providing their own guesses. The game incorporates hill climbing optimization to guide players towards the correct word. It offers four difficulty levels, ranging from easy to extreme, with different word lengths and limited attempts. Hints are available to assist players along the way.

## Features

- Four difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard, and extreme
- Random word selection from the nltk English dictionary based on difficulty level
